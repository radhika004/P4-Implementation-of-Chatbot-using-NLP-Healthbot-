# HealthBot - A Chatbot for Health-Related Queries

## Overview

<p><b>HealthBot</b> is a chatbot built using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques designed to answer general health-related queries. The chatbot provides information on a wide range of health topics, including symptoms, treatments, wellness advice, and more. It can be used to help users find quick answers to common health questions and provide first-level assistance.</p>

<p>The chatbot uses <b>TF-IDF</b> and <b>cosine similarity</b> to process user input and match it with predefined patterns. The project was developed using Python and deployed through a simple web interface using <b>Streamlit</b>.</p>

## Features

<p><b>Health Information</b>: Provides information on common health-related topics such as symptoms, prevention, and general wellness.</p>
<p><b>Customizable</b>: Easily extendable with new health topics and responses by modifying the <code>intents.json</code> file.</p>
<p><b>User-Friendly Interface</b>: Built using <b>Streamlit</b>, providing a simple and intuitive user interface.</p>
<p><b>Pattern Matching</b>: Utilizes <b>TF-IDF</b> and <b>cosine similarity</b> for effective matching of user queries with predefined health topics.</p>

## Technologies Used

<p><b>Python</b>: The primary programming language used for backend development.</p>
<p><b>Streamlit</b>: A framework for creating interactive web applications to interact with the chatbot.</p>
<p><b>NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)</b>: Used for tokenization, lemmatization, and other NLP tasks.</p>
<p><b>scikit-learn</b>: For implementing <b>TF-IDF</b> and <b>cosine similarity</b> for pattern matching.</p>
<p><b>Matplotlib</b>: Used to create charts, such as the accuracy pie chart for evaluating chatbot performance.</p>

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

<p>Ensure you have the following installed:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Python 3.x</b></li>
  <li><b>pip</b> (Python package manager)</li>
</ul>

### Step 1: Clone the repository

<p>Clone the repository to your local machine.</p>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/radhika004/P4-Implementation-of-Chatbot-using-NLP-Healthbot-/tree/main
cd HealthBot
```

### Step 2: Install dependencies

<p>Install the required Python libraries using pip.</p>

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

<p>The <code>requirements.txt</code> file includes:</p>

nltk==3.6.3
scikit-learn==0.24.2
streamlit==0.87.0
matplotlib==3.4.3


### Step 3: Download or create `intents.json`

<p>Ensure you have the <code>intents.json</code> file in the root directory of the project. This file defines the intents, patterns, and responses used by the chatbot.</p>

### Step 4: Run the app

<p>To start the chatbot and run the app, use the following command:</p>

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

<p>This will launch the web interface where you can interact with the chatbot.</p>

## How to Use

<ol>
  <li>After running the Streamlit app, a web interface will open in your default browser.</li>
  <li>Type a health-related query into the input box, such as "What is acne?" or "What are the symptoms of a cold?"</li>
  <li>The chatbot will process your input and provide a relevant response based on predefined patterns in the <code>intents.json</code> file.</li>
</ol>

## Accuracy and Performance

<p>The chatbot uses <b>TF-IDF</b> and <b>cosine similarity</b> to match user queries with predefined health topics. The accuracy of the system is based on how well the patterns match the queries, which can be monitored using performance metrics, such as an <b>accuracy pie chart</b> that shows the ratio of correct versus incorrect responses.</p>

## Future Work

<ul>
  <li><b>Improve NLP models</b>: Incorporate more advanced NLP models such as <b>BERT</b> or <b>GPT</b> for more complex queries and better responses.</li>
  <li><b>Expand knowledge base</b>: Add more health-related topics and responses to the chatbot.</li>
  <li><b>Voice Interaction</b>: Implement voice recognition so users can speak to the chatbot instead of typing.</li>
  <li><b>Multilingual Support</b>: Add support for multiple languages to reach a broader audience.</li>
  <li><b>Medical API Integration</b>: Integrate medical APIs to provide real-time and up-to-date information for symptoms and conditions.</li>
</ul>
